# CS340-Final-Project
Final project for CS 340 - Introduction to Databases. Standard web frontend 
with MySQL/PHP backend. 

SatelliteDB is a website that allows for the categorization and viewing of information
about various orbital bodies. User sessions are implemented via PHP, and users can
add and favorite database objects. Each object has an individual page that uses PHP
to fetch and display dynamic information from the backend.
